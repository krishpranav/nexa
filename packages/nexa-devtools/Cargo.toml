# In a real scenario, nexa-devtools would likely depend on nexa-core to access types,
# but to avoid circular deps if core uses devtools, we might use traits or generic types.
# However, user says "Expose runtime inspection API", implying we might be part of core or wrapping it.
# Let's assume nexa-devtools defines the protocol and types, and nexa-core implements them or pushes data to it.
# Or better, nexa-devtools provides a `DevTools` struct that nexa-core can populate.
